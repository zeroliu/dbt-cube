This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` (or create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## AI-Powered Chart Generator

This application includes an AI-powered chart generator that uses the OpenAI API (GPT-4o model) to:

1. Process natural language questions about your data
2. Automatically create chart suggestions based on your requirements
3. Generate Cube.js payloads for previewing in the chart interface

To use this feature:

- Click on the "Ask AI" button in the dashboard
- Enter your question or requirements in natural language
- The AI will analyze your data structure and suggest appropriate charts
- Preview the generated charts and add them to your dashboard if desired
